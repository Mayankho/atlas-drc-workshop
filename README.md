# Building Interactive Maps with Mapbox

Kinshasa Atlas Workshop

## Overview

Location data is all around us, and has become an increasingly important component of web & mobile apps users love. In this hands-on workshop, we'll learn how to build an interactive, custom visualization using open data and free, open-source tools from Mapbox. Through a hands-on project, we will cover basic web mapping concepts and tools, including:
- Editing & styling maps in Mapbox Atlas, an offline map data & design tool for creating beautiful custom map styles
- Use custom Atlas styles for digitizing in JOSM
- Developing map visualizations with Kepler, a powerful and easy to use open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets
- Process imagery and data for use in Mapbox Atlas


### Goals

By completing this workshop you'll learn how to on day 1:
- Create & publish a new style in Studio from a template
- Add a new layer with a custom tileset source to a style in Studio
- Consume in JOSM a published aerial imagery style from Atlas
- Build two different custom visualizations in Kepler from a single CSV dataset

and on day 2:
- Power up the Flyaway kit & connect with an external monitor
- Connect the Flyway kit to a different (e.g. networked) router
- Load and process imagery into a tileset
- Load and process a geojson or Shapefile into a tileset

### Prerequisites

No prior experience with geographic data or web mapping is required; basic familiarity web applications is assumed but everyone is welcome.
