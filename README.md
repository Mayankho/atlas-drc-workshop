Kinshasa Workshop

## Overview

In this hands-on workshop, we'll learn how to build custom maps & visualizations using open data and free, open-source, offline-ready tools from Mapbox. Through hands-on activities, we will cover basic Mapbox concepts and tools, including:
- Editing & styling maps in Mapbox Atlas, an offline map data & design tool
- Using custom Atlas styles for digitizing in JOSM
- Developing map visualizations with Kepler, a powerful and easy to use open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets
- Processing imagery and data for use in Mapbox Atlas


### Goals

By completing this workshop you'll learn how to...

Day 1:
- Create & publish a new style in Studio from a template
- Add a new layer with a custom tileset source to a style in Studio
- Consume in JOSM a published aerial imagery style from Atlas
- Build two different custom visualizations in Kepler from a single CSV dataset

Day 2:
- Set up the Flyaway kit & connect with an external monitor
- Connect the Flyway kit to a different (e.g. networked) router
- Load and process imagery into a tileset
- Load and process a geojson or Shapefile into a tileset

### Prerequisites

Some familiarity with working geographic data and OpenStreetMap is helpful. No experience with web mapping is required. Basic familiarity web applications is assumed. But everyone is welcome.

### What you'll need

- Laptop with browser (Chrome or Firefox preferred)
